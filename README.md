# boiler-pack
This is a (slightly) opinionated boilerplate starter project for creating React apps. It's based on the technologies/conventions that the Farmobile Web Team uses in their production apps.

If you want something more bare bones, and less opinionated, use [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app) instead.

### Features Include:
* webpack (v2)
* babel
* react
* react-router (v4)
* Hot Module Reloading
* ESlint
* PreCss/PostCSS
* webpack-dashboard

### Getting Started
First things first...be sure that you have `node` and `yarn` installed on your system. You can check to see if they're already installed by running the command `node -v` or `yarn --version`. If needed, follow these directions for [installing Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) or [installing Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install).

```bash
# after cloning/downloading the repo...
# navigate to the directory containing the package.json file
cd /path/to/files

# install the packages
yarn install

# start the development server (HMR)
yarn start
```
